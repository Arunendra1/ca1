<h1 style="color:blue;"><center><u>REFRIGERATOR</u></center> </h1>
As already brought out,refrigeration has two main uses:
<ol>
<li><b>Air conditioning</b></li>
<li><b>Food preservation</b></li>
<h2 style="color:skyblue;"><b><i>Defination:</b></i></h2>
<p>The Refrigerator is the the cooling household appliance system where<br>
removing the heat from the system to surrounding by the heat pump <br>so that the
inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the<br>ambient temperature of the room. 
<h2 style="color:yellow;"><b><i>Ambient Temperature:</b></i></h2>
<h3 style="color:lightgreen;"<b>Main Parts or component of Refrigerator:</b></h3>
It consists of the 4 main components or parts:<br>
<center><img src="screenshot.png"width="500px"height="300px"alt=""></center>
<ol>
<li><b><u>Evaporation</u></b></li>
<p>In most of the common refrigeratiors,evaporation coils are wound around<br>
the freezer cabinet.</P>
<p>Sometimes they are placed between two seats to form a freezer cabinet.<br>
the coil h s no fins due to the frosting that collects on it over a period <br> and due to 
low draft by natural convection.</p>
<p>in frost-free refrigerator, the evaporated is finned and the air is<br> circulated over it by the fan.</p>
<p>The Frost on the evaporator is melted by a very low capacity heating <br>element.</p>
<p>During the cyclical cut off period of the refrigerator, the electric heater<br>
switch on the defrost the evaporator. It is switched off before the restart<br>
of the compressor.</p>
<p>In this refrigerators, there is forced air circulation due to a finned<br>
evaporator and independent compartments.</p>
<li><b><u>Compressor:</b></u></li>
<p>It is hermetically sealed unit with the reciprocating compressor as the<br>
most common type of compressor.</p>
<p>In some large refrigerators, use of rotary or screw compressor is possible.<br>
 But the use is limited due to the high cost.</p>
<p>The compressor unit is mounted on the rear side of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>The compressor motor capacity ranges from 1/8 to 1/4 HP depending <br>
upon the size of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>The starting relay also has overload protection to protect the compressor<br>
 motor against higher current due to low voltage or tripling of the power supply.</p>
<li><b><u>Condenser:</b></u></li>
<p>In normal refrigerators, a condenser is installed on the rear side. The air<br>
circulation is by natural convection.</p>
<p>In the Frost free refrigerators, the condenser tube is on the inside of the<br>
outer cabinet of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>This arrangement prevents condensation on the outer cabinet in humid<br>
 condition. It also allows placing the refrigerated close to the wall.</p>
<li><b><u>Expansion device:</u></b></li>
<p>In this system, the capillary tube is used as an expansion device.</p>
<p>The capillary is long due to the large difference between condenser<br>
 pressure and evaporator pressure.</p>
<p>The capillary is sometimes soldered on the outside of the suction line and<br>
 insulated to provide liquid-suction heat exchanger.</p>
<p>There is a dryer strainer before the capillary tube.</p>
<h3 style="color:lightgreeen;"<b>Advantages, Disadvantages, Application of Refrigerator:
Application:</b></h3>
<p>Refrigerators are used mainly in keeping the refrigeration space cold.</P>
<p>By keeping the refrigeration space cold, the presence of micro-organisms<br>
such as Bacteria, Fungi is slowed down. They are not able to multiply fast <br>
enough to damage cells present in our foods and drinks.</p>
<p>Therefore, our food and drinks could be preserved over a long duration.</p>
<p>In the System, the bacteria and fungi become inactive under extremely <br>
lower temperatures.</p>
<h3 style="color:lightgreeen;"<b>Refrigerators are also used for medical and scientific purposes for the same reason.</b></h3>
<p>For medical use, items such as blood and vaccines are stored in it for <br>
preservation.</P>
<p>For Scientific use, experimental samples are stores in it.</p>
<p>Used for making ice and ice-creams apart from storage of food.</p>
<p>Many drugs which are to be kept away from direct sunlight and heat like <br>
insulin are also stored in refrigerators for longevity.</p>
